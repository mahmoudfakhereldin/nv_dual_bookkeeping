# NV Dual Bookkeeping

**Version:** 18.0.1.0.0
**Author:** NV
**License:** LGPL-3
**Depends:** `account`

Implements a dual-bookkeeping system for Lebanese companies by adding an
**Official (O) / Non-Official (NO)** flag to every financial transaction.
Each journal maintains two independent `ir.sequence` streams. The Official
sequence master always lives in the designated Official Company — operating
company journals borrow from it, ensuring gap-free, conflict-free numbering
across all companies.

## Installation

1. Copy the `nv_dual_bookkeeping` folder into your Odoo addons path.
2. Enable Developer Mode: **Settings → Activate Developer Mode**.
3. Update the app list: **Apps → Update Apps List**.
4. Search for **"NV Dual Bookkeeping"** and click **Install**.

During installation the `post_init_hook` runs automatically and creates a
Non-Official sequence for every existing journal. Check the server log for
a summary line:

```
nv_dual_bookkeeping post_init_hook complete. Total journals: X | NO sequences created: Y …
```

## Configuration

### Step 1 — Set the Official Mirror Company

**Settings → Accounting → Dual Bookkeeping → Official Mirror Company**

Select the company that will act as the authoritative Official Books ledger.
All Official transactions posted in the operating company will be mirrored here.

Alternatively, set it per-company in **Settings → Companies → [company] →
Official Company**.

### Step 2 — Link Journals

**Accounting → Dual Bookkeeping → Link Official Journals**

The wizard opens pre-populated with all journals of the current company.

| Button | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| Auto-Match by Code | Matches journals where `code` is identical in both companies |
| Auto-Match by Name | Case-insensitive substring match on journal name |
| Confirm | Persists all mappings; shows linked / unmatched count |

A journal that is unlinked will fall back to its own local sequence for
Official transactions (a warning is shown on the journal form).

### Step 3 — Assign User Groups

Go to **Settings → Users** and assign:

| Group | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Can Mark Transactions as Non-Official** | Allows toggling the O/NO flag to Non-Official on draft transactions |
| **Dual Bookkeeping Sync Manager** | Allows manual sync triggers and retry from the Sync Dashboard |

### Step 4 — Optional Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Default new transactions as Official | ✓ True | Pre-fills the O/NO toggle to Official on all new transactions |
| Require explicit O/NO selection before posting | False | Forces the user to consciously set the flag before posting |
| Auto-post mirrored transactions | False | Posts mirrors automatically; **leave False** for review workflow |
| Block direct posting in Official Company | False | Prevents any non-mirror entry being posted in the official company |

## Key Behaviours

### Sequence Routing

| Scenario | Sequence used |
|----------|--------------|
| Post Official transaction, journal has `official_journal_id` | Official company journal's `sequence_id` (master) |
| Post Official transaction, journal has no `official_journal_id` | Journal's own local `sequence_id` (fallback) |
| Post Non-Official transaction | Journal's `sequence_no_id` (local, always) |

This means:
- All Official entries share a single gapless counter per journal regardless of which company posts them.
- Non-Official entries have their own counter that never interferes.

### Sync Engine

When an Official transaction is posted in an operating company:

1. Guard checks run (not a mirror, not already synced, official company configured).
2. A mirror `account.move` is created in the official company via `sudo().with_company(official_co)`.
3. Each account is matched by code in the official company's chart of accounts.
4. The partner is matched by VAT, then name, then auto-created as a stub.
5. A `nv.sync.log` record is written with `state='synced'`.
6. If `auto_post_mirror=True`, the mirror is posted automatically.

**Sync failures are non-blocking.** If the sync engine raises any exception:
- The original posting is NOT rolled back.
- An error log is written to `nv.sync.log`.
- A sticky bus notification warns the user to check the Sync Dashboard.

### Locking

- `is_official` **cannot be changed** after a transaction is posted (enforced in `write()`).
- Setting `is_official=False` requires the **Can Mark Transactions as Non-Official** group.

## Sync Dashboard

**Accounting → Dual Bookkeeping → Sync Dashboard**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sync Date | When the sync was attempted |
| Source Transaction | Original move in the operating company (clickable) |
| Mirror Transaction | Created move in the official company (clickable) |
| State | Synced (green) / Error (red) / Pending (orange) |
| Error Message | Shown for failed syncs |

**Retry All Failed** (header button): re-triggers every error record.
**Retry** (per row): re-triggers a single record.

Both buttons are restricted to the **Dual Bookkeeping Sync Manager** group.

---

## Menus

All menus live under **Accounting → Dual Bookkeeping**:

| Menu | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Official Transactions | account.move list filtered to is_official=True |
| Non-Official Transactions | account.move list filtered to is_official=False |
| Sync Dashboard | nv.sync.log list with retry actions |
| Link Official Journals | Journal mapping wizard |
| Summary Report | Pivot: journal × O/NO with amount_total measure |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Journal has no Official sequence configured"
The journal's `official_journal_id` is not set. Open the journal, go to the
**Dual Bookkeeping** tab, and set **Official Company Journal**, or use the
**Link Official Journals** wizard.

### "Account '{code}' not found in official company"
The chart of accounts in the official company is missing account `{code}`.
Install the same chart of accounts in both companies, or manually create the
missing account with the same code.

### Mirror not created / Sync Dashboard shows error
1. Open the error record in the Sync Dashboard.
2. Read the **Error Message** field for the root cause.
3. Fix the underlying issue (missing account, missing journal mapping, etc.).
4. Click **Retry** on the error record.

### post_init_hook failed for some journals
Check the server log for `[ERROR]` lines from `post_init_hook`. These indicate
journals where the NO sequence could not be created. Fix the issue and either:
- Re-install the module (safe — the hook is idempotent for already-migrated journals), or
- Manually call `journal._create_no_sequence()` from an Odoo shell.

### Sequence gaps appear in the Official sequence
This usually means a transaction was posted directly in the official company
without going through the sync engine. Enable **Block direct manual posting in
Official Company** in settings to prevent this going forward.
